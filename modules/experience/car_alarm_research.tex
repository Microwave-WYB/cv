\begin{joblong}{Remote Vehicle Control Systems Security Research (UCSD)}{June 2024 -- present}
	\item Led end-to-end security evaluation of aftermarket Bluetooth Low Energy car alarm ecosystem, reverse-engineering \textbf{6 major systems} and uncovering \textbf{3 critical zero-day vulnerabilities} impacting \textbf{1.4M+ vehicles across North America}
	\item Developed novel MAC addressâ€“based population estimation methodology using crowdsourced wardriving data, enabling the first population-scale measurement of IoT vulnerability exposure
	\item Conducted reverse engineering of proprietary BLE authentication protocols, identifying authentication bypasses and insecure cryptographic implementations that allowed full remote takeover
	\item Coordinated responsible disclosure with manufacturers and regulators (including NHTSA), balancing ethical considerations with urgent real-world impact
	\item Directed cross-functional research team while performing hands-on protocol analysis, authoring a comprehensive study \textbf{under review at USENIX Security 2026}
